            <h2>Short Bio</h2>
            <h3>With a background in Physics, Mathematics and Progamming, I am passionated about
                technology and complex systems.
            </h3>
            <p>
                I studied Physics at University, an academic pursuit which endowed me with a robust foundation on calculus, algebra, and probability theory. The knowledge of these mathematical concepts would be of advantage later when facing the modern professional landscape.</p>

<p>When transitioning into the corporate realm, I first worked as a data consultant. In this role, I crafted insightful visualization dashboards that distilled intricate data into comprehensible insight. Furthermore, I also queried consumer databases to orchestrate personalised marketing campaigns. In essence, I was filling the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making, by transforming data into actionable business strategies.</p>

<p>Eager to further sharpen my expertise, I embarked on an EngD program about geometric deep learning in the context of medical imaging. This ambitious endeavour fused my mathematical proficiency with my technological aspirations, as I delved into the burgeoning field of AI and its applications in healthcare. As a result of these efforts, I produced 4 different publications on impactful conferences, and I expect to graduate in October 2023.</p>

<p>Collectively, my trajectory has bestowed me with a potent amalgamation of skills. I possess a solid mathematical foundation, fortified by my academic background in Physics. I developed the skill to extract insights from different data sources. Ultimately, these experiences not only turned me into a dynamic professional but also fuelled my desire to continue pushing the boundaries of technological advancements in data analysis and medical imaging.</p>
